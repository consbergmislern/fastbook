You can also use it to play sounds or music in the background of your voice chat. With a voice changer, you can create endless possibilities of fun and entertainment on Discord.
 
But how do you get a FREE voice changer for Discord? There are many options available online, but not all of them are reliable, safe, or easy to use.
